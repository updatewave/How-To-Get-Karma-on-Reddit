# [Reddit karma](https://updatewave.com/how-to-get-reddit-karma/) is a point system used on the social media platform Reddit to measure a user's contribution and engagement. 
It reflects the total upvotes minus downvotes received on a user's posts and comments. Karma is divided into post karma and comment karma.
It serves as a rough indicator of a user's reputation and the quality of their contributions.
Accumulating karma can increase a user's credibility and visibility on the platform, while negative karma may result in limitations. 
However, it's important to remember that karma is not a definitive measure of someone's worth or expertise.
